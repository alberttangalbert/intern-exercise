The median age was 61.5 years, 70.6% pts had ECOG PS of 1. 60.3% primary tumor sites were left-sided CRC, 39.7% were right-sided CRC. 45.6% of pts were PD-L1 CPS\u22651. For the 68 pts, 61 pts(89.7%) experienced treatment related adverse events(TRAEs), 19 pts(27.9%) experienced grade\u22653 TRAEs. The most common TRAEs (\u226520%) included aspartate aminotransferase increased (30.9%), anaemia (30.9%), neutrophil count decreased (29.4%), alanine aminotransferase increased (22.1%), platelet count decreased (20.6%), white blood cell count decreased (20.6%).TRAE leading to treatment delay occurred in 25% of pts, no TRAE leading to treatment discontinuation.67 pts underwent at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment. The overall ORR and DCR were 68.66% and 98.51% while the ORR and DCR respectively were 58.82%/94.12%, 62.5%/100%, 88.24%/100% and 64.71%/100% in A1, A2, B1 and B2 group. SSGJ-707 5mg/kg Q3W+XELOX demonstrated promising efficacy results in treatment naive mCRC.\n\n\nConclusions:\nSSGJ-707 in combination with XELOX/mFOLFOX6 demonstrated promising efficacy results in 1L mCRC with manageable safety profile. The study of SSGJ-707 monotherapy in \u22653L mCRC and in combination with chemotherapy for the whole pMMR/MSS 1L mCRC pts is ongoing.\n\n\n[Search with abstract number at below URL and click on

Overall, the median age was 64 years, 83.1% had ECOG PS of 1, 44.6% of pts with squamous cell carcinoma, 66.3% and 33.7% of pts had PD-L1 expression 1%-49% and \u226550%. Among the 76 pts completed at least one efficacy evaluation, ORR and DCR were 29.6% (8/27)/85.2% (23/27), 61.8%(21/34)97.1% (33/34), 54.5% (6/11)/90.9% (10/11) and 25% (1/4)/75% (3/4) at doses of 5mg/kg Q3W, 10mg/kg Q3W, 20mg/kg Q3W and 30 mg/kg Q3W, respectively. SSGJ-707 10mg/kg Q3W demonstrated promising efficacy results in treatment naive advanced NSCLC. Select subgroups are summarized in SSGJ-707 10mg/kg Q3W. The ORR were 54.5% (12/22) and 75%(9/12) in non-squamous and squamous pts respectively. And the ORR were 57% (12/21) and 69%(9/13) in PD-L1 TPS 1%-49% and \u2265 50% pts respectively. 25 pts completed at least two efficacy evaluation in SSGJ-707 10mg/kg Q3W, the ORR was 72% (18/25), DCR was 100% (25/25). For the 83 pts, 65 pts (78.3%) experienced treatment related adverse events (TRAEs), 20 pts (24.1%) experienced grade\u22653 TRAEs. The most common TRAEs included hypercholesterolaemia (18.1%,15/83), hypertriglyceridaemia (18.1%,15/83), alanine aminotransferase increased (15.7%,13/83) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (15.7%,13/83).

Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).\n\nPercentage of Participants Achieving a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) [ Time Frame: At Week 12 ]\nThe sPGA is the physician's determination of the participant's Ps lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. Participants Ps were assessed as 0 (clear), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), or 5 (very severe). An sPGA responder was defined as having a postbaseline sPGA score of \u201c0\u201c or \u201c1\u201c with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline.\n\nIn the IMP Group, Percentage of Participants Still Maintaining PASI 75, PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 At Week 52 From Week 12 for Participants Who Achieved PASI 75, PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 [ Time Frame: At Week 52 ]\nThe PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored by itself and the scores then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as: sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs(0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).\n\nPercentage of Participants Achieving an Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) \u22654 Point Reduction From Baseline for Participants Who Had Baseline Itch NRS \u22654 [ Time Frame: At Week 12 ]\nThe Itch NRS is a participant-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 (no itch) and 10 (worst itch imaginable). Overall severity of a participant's itching from Ps is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours.\n\nKey secondary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of subjects achieving PASI 90 at week 12 of dosing.\nKey secondary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of subjects achieving PASI 100 at week 12 of dosing.\nKey secondary efficacy endpoint: Proportion of subjects achieving sPGA 0 at week 12 of dosing.\nIn the experimental drug group, the subjects who achieved PASI 75, PASI 90, and sPGA 0/1 at the 12th week of administration still maintained the proportion of subjects with PASI 75, PASI 90, and sPGA 0/1 at the 52nd week.\nProportion of subjects with a baseline pruritus (pruritus) Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) \u2265 4 points whose NRS score decreased by \u2265 4 points from baseline at week 12 of dosing\nProportion of subjects achieving PASI 75, sPGA 0/1, PASI 90, PASI 100, sPGA 0 at other assessment time points except week 12 of dosing.\nChange in PASI from baseline and percent improvement.\nChange from baseline in percent body surface area (BSA) involvement in psoriasis.\t\nDLQI change from baseline and percent improvement.\nChange from baseline in pruritus (pruritus) Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score.\nTime to first achieve PASI 75, PASI 90, sPGA 0/1\t\nProportion of subjects who relapsed during double-blind maintenance therapy after treatment with the trial drug during the induction phase\t\nAdverse events, serious adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests and electrocardiogram, C-SSRS, etc.\t\nPharmacokinetic parameters\t\nAnti-drug antibody positive rate, titer and incidence of neutralizing antibody in subjects\t\n\nEvaluation time\nAt week 12\nWeek 12, Week 52\nProtocol-specified study period assessment visit points\ntime to first recurrence\nW0-W60"", ""otherEndpoints"": [{""otherEndpoint"": ""Adverse Events"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Safety/Toxicity"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Adverse Drug Reactions""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Cardiac Telemetry"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Safety/Toxicity"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Cardiac Measures/Events""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Change in PASI"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Clinical Response""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Patient Assessment Instruments (Efficacy)""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Dermatology Life Quality Index"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""HEOR"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Health-Related Quality Of Life (Patient Reported Outcomes) (HEOR)""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Immunogenicity"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Safety/Toxicity"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Adverse Drug Reactions""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Numeric Rating Scale"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Patient Assessment Instruments (Efficacy)""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""PASI100"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Clinical Response""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""PASI75"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Clinical Response""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""PASI90"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Clinical Response""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Physician's Global Assessment"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Patient Assessment Instruments (Efficacy)""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Serious Adverse Event"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Safety/Toxicity"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Serious Adverse Events""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Vital signs"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Safety/Toxicity"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Serious Adverse Events""}, {""otherEndpoint"": ""Worst Itch-Numeric Rating Scale"", ""otherEndpointGroup"": ""Efficacy"", ""otherEndpointSubGroup"": ""Symptom Assessment (Patient Reported Outcomes)""}]}",[],"[{""date"": ""2025-03-13T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""ChinaDrugTrials\n\nRegistration number: CTR20222943\nTest status: Completed\nSponsor name: Sunshine Guojian Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.\n\nDate when the first subject signed the informed consent: 2023-01-03\nDate of the first subject enrollment: 2023-01-07\nEnd date of the test: 2024-06-04\n\nTo access the study, follow the steps provided below:\n1.

The median age was 52 years (IQR 36-59), and the median PLT before treatment was 17\u00d7109/L (IQR 10-23). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups of patients. Within 42-day treatment period, time to response of rhTPO group was significantly shorter than that of eltrombopag group (median 7 days [95% CI 5-7] vs 15 days [95%CI 9-21]; p<0.001). In the subgroup with baseline PLT 20-<30\u00d7109/L, the median response time of rhTPO at an initial dose of 300 U/kg/day was 7 days, which was significantly faster than the 19 days of eltrombopag at an initial dose of 25 mg/day (p<0.001). Similarly, in the subgroup with baseline PLT <20\u00d710?/L, the initial dose of rhTPO at 600 U/kg/day also achieved a median response time of 7 days, which was shorter than the 14 days of eltrombopag at an initial dose of 50 mg/day (p<0.001). The response rate was higher in the rhTPO group compared with eltrombopag group: 65.7% vs. 22.9% at week 1, 81.4% vs. 51.4% at week 4, and 85.7% vs. 65.7% at week 6. The duration of PLTs =50\u00d7109/L was longer in the rhTPO group with a median of 23 days compared with 16 days in the eltrombopag group(p<0.001). Most adverse events observed were mild to moderate, and no new safety signals were found in either group.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is the first study comparing the efficacy and safety of an optimized rhTPO regimen with standard eltrombopag treatment in pre-treated ITP patients. This optimized rhTPO regimen demonstrated superior efficacy in rapidly elevating platelet counts to safe levels, maintaining safe platelet levels, and achieving high response rates, providing an effective therapy for ITP, especially in emergent treatment settings.

Clinicopathological characteristics and specimen information of the patients\nBetween March 2023 and February 2024, 76 patients underwent screening, of which 62 patients were subsequently randomized. Among the 62 enrolled patients, none withdrew from the trial due to AEs. Sixty-one patients completed the entire trial, while the treatment of one patient was terminated due to the personal reasons and the investigator's discretion (Fig. 1). All the enrolled patients (100 %) were included in the FAS, SS, PKCS, and IS, and 61 patients (98.4 %) were included in the PPS.All 62 patients in the FAS were female. The average age of all patients was 52.5 years. Forty (64.5 %) patients were ER positive, and 22 (35.5 %) patients were ER-negative. The baseline characteristics of the included patients are summarized\n\nConclusion \nThe primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR) rate, defined as ypT0/is and ypN0, assessed by independent central review. From March 2023 to February 2024, 62 patients were enrolled, with the majority (61/62) completing 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. The tpCR rate was 56.5 % (95 % CI: 43.3 %-69.0 %).

The results showed that the pathological complete remission (tpCR) rate of 4 cycles of inituzumab + pertuzumab + nab-paclitaxel neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer reached 56.5%...\n\n...Key highlights of the study:\n\n\u2705 The tpCR rate of the entire population is as high as 56.5% (95% CI: 43.3%-69.0%), bringing new hope to patients with HER2+ early breast cancer\n\n\u2705 The tpCR rate of ER-negative patients is as high as 90.9%\n\n\u2705 Objective response rate (ORR) reached 90.3%\n\n\u2705 Safety is controllable, with grade \u22653 adverse events mainly being hematological toxicity (neutropenia 32.3%), and no treatment-related deaths\n\n\u2705 No anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are produced during the whole process\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Research suggests: This regimen provides a new option for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, especially for ER-negative patients!...\n\n...Key findings\n\n1. Efficacy data: significantly improved pCR rate\n\nOverall population: The tpCR rate was 56.5% (35/62 cases; 95% confidence interval: 43.3%-69.0%), which is better than the performance of some trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy regimens in historical controls (approximately 40%-50%).\n\n[Refer to source URL for graphical data:]\n\nER-negative subgroup: In ER-negative (estrogen receptor-negative) patients, the tpCR rate was as high as 90.9% (20/22 cases), suggesting that this regimen may have stronger anti-tumor activity in hormone receptor-negative populations. Previous studies have shown that ER-negative/HER2-positive breast cancer responds better to dual-targeted therapy (such as trastuzumab + pertuzumab) than ER-positive patients, and the findings of this study further support this rule.\n\n[Refer to source URL for graphical data:]\n\nObjective response rate: 90.3% of patients achieved complete or partial response, indicating that the treatment was effective in reducing tumor size.\n\n2. Safety: Controllable adverse events\n\nHematological toxicity: Grade \u22653 adverse events were mainly neutropenia (32.3%) and leukopenia (19.4%), which are consistent with the known toxicity spectrum of nab-paclitaxel.\n\nNon-hematological toxicity: The incidence of infectious pneumonia (3.2%) and diarrhea (3.2%) was low, and there were no treatment-related deaths.\n\n3. Immunogenicity: No anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in all patients during the entire treatment period, indicating that the immunogenicity risk of inituzumab is extremely low.\n\nin conclusion\n\n The neoadjuvant therapy of inituzumab combined with pertuzumab and albumin-paclitaxel has shown encouraging efficacy and controllable safety in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, especially providing a potential high-efficiency treatment option for ER-negative patients. This study not only provides new strategies for clinical practice, but also lays an important foundation for the development and application of domestic innovative drugs. In the future, as more evidence accumulates, this regimen is expected to become one of the standard options for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zuo WJ, Ma LX, Wang ZH, et al.

There are 3 dose groups (100 mg、200 mg and 300 mg) in phase Ib and 10 participants in each group.

The phase II study is a dose-ranging, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study examining the effect of 2 dose regimens (200 mg and 300 mg, based on the outcome of phase Ib) of recombinant anti-IL-1β humanized monoclonal antibody injection versus compound betamethasone injection for the treatment of acute flare in Chinese gout patients in whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response. The phase II recommended dose of SSGJ-613 in subjects with acute gouty was determined according to the phase Ib interim analysis results.

At baseline, the mean VAS scores for the targeted joints were 72.4mm, 66.8mm, and 67.4mm in the SSGJ-613 200 mg, SSGJ-613 300 mg, and Betamethasone 1mL groups, respectively. 72 hours after administration, all treatment groups exhibited significant pain relief, with VAS scores changes from baseline (mean standard deviation) being -45.8 17.88 mm, -40.4 17.35 mm, and -48.2 15.90 mm for the SSGJ-613 200 mg group, SSGJ-613 300 mg group, and Betamethasone, respectively. There were no statistical differences between the two SSGJ-613 doses and Betamethasone(p=0.4533 and 0.0848 for SSGJ-613 200mg and 300mg, respectively). More importantly, the percentage of patients developing new flares was remarkably lower for all SSGJ-613 groups compared with Betamethasone, with 16.7% (5/30) and 14.3% (4/28) for the SSGJ-613 200mg and 300mg doses, respectively, versus 51.6% (16/31) for Betamethasone 1mL. Regrading inflammatory factors, hsCRP, SAA, and ESR decreased rapidly in all three groups at 72 hours after dosing, with SSGJ-613 doses showing more pronounced reduction on hsCRP and SAA than Betamethasone. Safety profile was comparable between SSGJ-613 and Betamethasone, with a relatively low incidence in SSGJ-613 groups.\n\nConclusions:\nThese results demonstrated that a single injection of SSGJ-613 could achieve rapid pain relief similar to that of steroids in Chinese patients with gout and provide effective prophylaxis against flares. To confirm the efficacy and safety of SSGJ-613 in Chinese gout patients, further trials will be initiated soon.\n\nRefer to Source URL for graphical data\nhttps://scientific.sparx-ip.net/archiveeular/?c=a&view=2&item=2024AB0190""}, {""date"": ""2023-07-14T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""July 14, 2023 [Press release]\n\nSunshine Guojian's Phase II Clinical Trial of Recombinant Anti-IL-1\u03b2 Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Injection (SSGJ-613) in the Treatment of Acute Gouty Arthritis Reached the Primary Endpoint\n\nSunshine Guojian (stock code: 688336.SH), the pioneer of antibody drugs in China, announced that the recombinant anti-IL-1\u03b2 humanized monoclonal antibody injection (SSGJ-613) independently developed by the company was tested in acute gouty arthritis A study conducted by the authors of \""Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of Recombinant Anti-Interleukin 1-\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Injection (SSGJ-613) Subcutaneously Treating Subjects with Acute Gouty Arthritis , Pharmacokinetic characteristics and effectiveness Phase Ib/II clinical study\"", reaching the main research endpoint.\n\nThe trial is divided into two research phases, Phase Ib and Phase II, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single subcutaneous injection of different doses of SSGJ-613 in the treatment of subjects with acute gouty arthritis.\n\nThe above two studies included a total of 120 subjects, based on the data of 89 subjects who used SSGJ-613 and 31 subjects who used the positive control drug of Deprosone hormone in Phase Ib and II, fully confirmed the efficacy of SSGJ-613 in acute gout It is effective in alleviating arthritis pain and preventing recurrence.

"A Single-center, Single-arm, Open-label, Single-dose Phase I Clinical Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Safety and Tolerability of rhTPO in Healthy Caucasian Participants. Approximately 22 Subjects Will be Enrolled.","This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, single-dose phase I clinical study to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability of Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin for Injection (rhTPO) in healthy Caucasian participants. Approximately 22 healthy Caucasian participants will be enrolled for this study.

One dose level is planned in this study, and participants will receive a single abdominal subcutaneous injection at a dose of 300 U/kg after entering the study.

Participants will undergo screening, admission (baseline), administration and follow-up observation period. Participants will sign an informed consent form before any study procedures are performed. During screening, all participants will be screened for study eligibility within 28 days prior to administration. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical study ward no later than one day prior to dosing (D-1). Participants need to fast for at least 10 hours prior to dosing and 4 hours after dosing. Single abdominal subcutaneous injection of the study drug will be given on D1. The administration and follow-up observation period will be 29 days (D1\~D29). Participants may be discharged at D7 at the judgment of the investigator. PK blood samples will be collected from D-1 to D14, tolerance and safety will be observed from D1 to D29, and blood samples for PD and ADA will be collected from screening to D29. After completion of relevant assessments on D29, participants will be considered as having completed this study.

This study is testing the safety, tolerability (if any side effects occur), pharmacokinetics (PK; the amount of investigational drug or any breakdown products in your blood), pharmacodynamics (PD; how the investigational drug affects your body), and Immunogenicity (the ability of cells/tissues to provoke an immune response) of a single dose of an investigational drug called Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin for Injection- (rhTPO). This study drug has been marketed in China and other nine (9) countries since 2005, treating patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT), under the trade name of TPIAO.

Drug :  Injection of humanized nerve growth factor (NGF) antibody， Dosage Form :  Injection， Dosage :  20-60 mg ， Frequency :  Single dose， Duration :  efficacy assessed over 12 weeks

Phase Ib - Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion:

This phase is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial involving single-dose administration of SSS40 injection. Patients will be enrolled into sequential dose cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of escalating doses of SSS40. Based on observed adverse events, particularly dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and PK data, the sponsor and investigators will determine whether adjustments to the dose escalation scheme (e.g., dosing interval, cohort size) are needed or if additional unplanned dose levels should be added. Following initial dose-escalation, a dose-expansion cohort will be conducted at the selected dose level to further characterize safety and gather additional preliminary efficacy data.

Phase IIa - Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial:

After sufficient safety and efficacy data are obtained from Phase Ib, the sponsor and investigators may proceed to Phase IIa. This phase will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK of SSS40 injection in patients with moderate-to-severe bone metastatic cancer pain.

Solid tumor clinical trial \""Drug Clinical Trial Approval Notice\"", and phase I clinical trials will be launched in the near future.\n\n\nSSGJ-617 is the first antagonistic antibody in China that targets PSGL-1. It can induce the functional reprogramming of M2-like macrophages and convert them to an M1-like phenotype, thereby generating an anti-tumor pro-inflammatory immune response.\n\n\nPSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in immune cell trafficking in response to tissue damage or inflammation. Macrophages can exert diverse functional roles in response to signals in their microenvironment, including the ability to direct pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses. The SSGJ-617 monoclonal antibody can bind to PSGL-1 with high affinity, causing macrophage reprogramming, inducing the tumor microenvironment to activate the recruitment of T cells and other immune cells, and conducting a coordinated immune attack on tumors.

The study is divided into two stages. The first stage lasts for 18 weeks, and is divided into fixed dose period (day 1~ 6th week ) and dose adjustment period (7th ~ 18th week). The second stage lasts for 28 weeks, and is also divided into dose adjustment period (19th ~ 38th week) and evaluation period (39th ~ 46th week).
Patients are randomly assigned to seven study groups in the first stage. Of all these seven groups, six groups are: Group A (0.8µg/kg RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, for 18 weeks) Group B (1.2µg/kg RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, for 18 weeks) Group C (1.6µg/kg RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, for 18 weeks) Group D (0.8ug/kg RD01, once every two weeks, intravenous injection, for 18 weeks) Group E ( 150 IU/kg rHuEPO, once a week, subcutaneous injection, for 18 weeks ) Group F (8µl /kg placebo, once every two weeks, for 6 weeks; then 150 IU/kg rHuEPO, once a week, subcutaneous injection, 7th ~ 18th week ).

At the beginning of the second stage, some patients in these six goups need to be be randomized again. Of which patients in Group A?B?C are randomly assigned to Group a ( RD01, once every two weeks, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week ) Group b (RD01, once every four weeks, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week) Group c (RD01, once every six weeks, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week); Patients in Group D enter directly to Group d (RD01, once every four weeks, intravenous injection, 19th ~ 46th week); Patients in Group E and F are randomly assigned to Group e (rHuEPO once a week, intravenous injection, 19th ~ 46th week ) and Group f (rHuEPO once a week, subcutaneous injection, 19th ~ 46th week). The starting dose of the second stage for individual patient in all groups refers to the weekly dose at the end of the first stage 

During the whole study period, all patients in six groups are not allowed to adjust dosage in the first 6 weeks, while in the remaining trial period dosage adjustment was allowed once every two weeks if necessary.

Primary Purpose: Treatment

This is a safety, tolerability, placebo control, dose escalation, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and single ascending dose study.","The improved Fibonacci dose escalation design will be implemented. The protocol specifies 10 mg, oral, one time for the first cohort without placebo control. Successive cohorts will be given doses up to 540 mg with placebo parallel control. Only no observation meets the criteria under stop rules, dose will escalate to the next higher level.

The study will be divided into 2 stages: 1st period (fast) and 2nd period(fed).
First period (fast): Subjects will be allocated 1:4 to receive placebo or SSS17, which will be administered by oral route. At each dose, tolerability, safety, PK and PD characteristics will be investigated.
Second period (fed): in order to investigate the effects of food on PK and PD of SSS17. Subjects in one cohort will be administered again after meal on Day15. The accurate dose will be adjusted according to the findings in 1st period (fast)

There were no deaths, serious AEs, or withdrawal from study due to AEs. The most frequent (>5%) drug-related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were serum iron decreased, serum ferritin decreased, unsaturated iron binding capacity increased, leukocyte count decreased, and diarrhea . No clinically significant findings in vital signs or electrocardiogram were observed. Positive ADA responses to RD01 were observed in 7 of 70 subjects. The exposure (AUC0-8) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of RD01 were approximately linear in the range of 0.2\u20134.8 ug/kg dose. The median Tmax was 48~96 hours, while mean t1/2 as 82.4~160.6 hours (Table 1 The PK parameters of RD01). While RD01 of 0.2- 4.8 \u00b5g/kg dose-dependently elevated hemoglobin, reticulocyte and hematocrit.

After reading this letter, I hope you will have a clear understanding of where we are going and how we plan to get there. This letter will focus on the support behind our decision to move into Phase 3 for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection, and the key process steps and timelines required for initiation of this late stage clinical program. Looking forward, I am confident that you will share my optimism for the future prospects of our company...\n\n...Transplantation - Our Greatest Opportunity\n\n...We have been intensely focused on initiating the Phase 3 development of voclosporin for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection. There are three key factors that support our commitment to the organ transplant rejection development pathway:  the market opportunity, the scientific rationale, and the clinical support...\n\n...Phase 3 Clinical Program - Process Steps and Timelines\n\nOur Phase 3 program will consist of two clinical trials, each enrolling approximately 600 new kidney transplant patients. One trial will be conducted primarily in the United States and Canada, while the second trial will enroll patients primarily in Europe. The cost of the clinical trials are estimated to be in the range of $27.5 to $30 million each. Importantly, we have already secured funding for the North American trial through our strategic partner, ILJIN Life Sciences. Ideally, we aim to run both trials in parallel so we can shorten the time to market. We are actively assessing opportunities to fund the European trial, preferably through a strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company interested in the transplant field.\n\nOur Phase 3 clinical trials aim to demonstrate non-inferiority in a composite endpoint, primarily driven by biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR), compared to tacrolimus. A key secondary endpoint will be the incidence of NODAT, as well as the overall safety and tolerability of voclosporin relative to tacrolimus.\n\nOn the regulatory front, we recently received positive Scientific Advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on our proposed phase 3 clinical trial protocol for voclosporin...We now await a similar outcome with the FDA in the US so that we can finalize our clinical plans.\n\nIn parallel with the regulatory activities, we have been actively engaged in the preparatory clinical work required prior to the enrolment of the patients. These activities include the selection of clinical trial sites, obtaining non-disclosure agreements with all parties, working with the data management clinical research organization (CRO) to design and test the electronic documents to be used by the clinical trial sites, and developing the project plans and processes with our CRO and other providers.\n\nAlongside the regulatory and clinical preparations, another key process step is having active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) ready to be administered to patients. A new batch of voclosporin has been ordered from the manufacturer and should be ready for patient use in the first half of 2012...\n\nhttp://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1911019257&view=64134-0&Start=&htm=0""}, {""date"": ""2011-11-01T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""November 1, 2011\n\nVoclosporin Phase 3 Development Timelines\n\nRegulatory\nReceived EMA Scientific Advice - Q3 2011\nExpect SPA approval from FDA - Q4 2011; Q1 2012\nIND filed and accepted - Q2 - Q3 2012\n\nClinical\n75 Clincal trial sites on-line - Q3 2012\nFirst Patient First Visit (FPFV) - Q3 2012\nEnrollment updates (18 months) - Q3 2012 - Q4 2013\nFinal patient starts dosing - Q1 2014\nLast Patient Last Visit (LPLV) - Q1 2015\nData available - Q2 2015\n\nhttp://stream1.newswire.ca/media/2011/11/01/20111101_C9257_DOC_EN_5871.pdf""}, {""date"": ""2011-10-18T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""October 18, 2011\n\nIsotechnika Receives Positive Scientific Advice From The European Medicines Agency\n\nEDMONTON, Oct. 18, 2011 /CNW/ - Isotechnika Pharma Inc. announced today that it has received positive Scientific Advice (SA) from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on its proposed phase 3 clinical trial protocol of its lead product candidate, voclosporin.

Based on these results, the ideal dose for a Phase 3 trial will encompass the concentration range obtained in the low to mid dose treatment groups... \n\n...Our next steps are to confirm our Phase 3 transplant protocol with the FDA... \n\nhttp://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1704213401&view=64134-0&Start=0""}]","[""Terminated, Planned but never initiated"", ""Terminated, Unknown""]",[],[],"[""active comparator"", ""double blind/blinded"", ""efficacy"", ""multiple arm"", ""non inferiority"", ""randomized"", ""safety""]","[""Registration""]","[{""drugApprovalStatus"": ""Approved"", ""drugId"": 23711, ""drugName"": ""voclosporin"", ""drugNameId"": 1030, ""drugNames"": [""ISA-247"", ""ISA247"", ""ISA247 (trans)"", ""ISAtx-247"", ""Lupkynis"", ""Luveniq"", ""LX-211"", ""LX211"", ""Orelvo"", ""R-1524"", ""R1524"", ""trans-ISA-247"", ""Voclera"", ""voclosporin""], ""drugParentNames"": [], ""drugPrimaryName"": ""voclosporin"", ""drugTherapeuticClassSynonyms"": [""Antirheumatic, immunological"", ""Arthritis, immunological"", ""Immunomodulator, antiarthritic"", ""Psoriasis""], ""drugTherapeuticClasses"": [""Antiarthritic, immunological"", ""Antipsoriasis"", ""Antiviral, other"", ""Immunosuppressant"", ""Ophthalmological, other"", ""Urological""], ""mechanismsOfAction"": [{""directMechanism"": ""Calcineurin inhibitor"", ""mechanismSynonyms"": [""Calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor"", ""Calcineurin protease inhibitor"", ""Calcineurin protein phosphatase inhibitor""]}, {""directMechanism"": ""Immunosuppressant"", ""mechanismSynonyms"": []}]}]","[{""drugApprovalStatus"": ""Approved"", ""drugId"": 12359, ""drugName"": ""Cellcept (tablet)"", ""drugNameId"": 299, ""drugNames"": [""Cellcept (tablet)"", ""MMF (tablet)"", ""Munoloc (tablet)"", ""mycophenolate mofetil (tablet)"", ""mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride (tablet)"", ""R-99 (tablet)"", ""R99 (tablet)"", ""Renodapt (tablet)"", ""RS-61443 (tablet)""], ""drugParentNames"": [""Cel-Sept"", ""Cellcept"", ""ME-MPA"", ""Munoloc"", ""mycophenolate mofetil"", ""R-99"", ""R99"", ""Renodapt"", ""RS-61443""], ""drugPrimaryName"": ""mycophenolate mofetil (tablet)"", ""drugTherapeuticClassSynonyms"": [""Anti-infective, immunomodulator"", ""Anti-inflammatory/-pruritic, non-allergic"", ""Antipruritic/-inflamm, non-allergic"", ""Antirheumatic, other"", ""Arthritis, other"", ""Asthma"", ""Cancer, other"", ""Cytostatic"", ""Dermatitis, non-allergic"", ""Eczema, non-allergic"", ""Non-allergic, antipruritic/-inflammatory""], ""drugTherapeuticClasses"": [""Antiarthritic, other"", ""Antiasthma"", ""Anticancer, other"", ""Antipruritic/inflamm, non-allergic"", ""Dermatological"", ""GI inflammatory/bowel disorders"", ""Immunological, unspecified"", ""Immunomodulator, anti-infective"", ""Immunosuppressant"", ""Musculoskeletal"", ""Urological""], ""mechanismsOfAction"": [{""directMechanism"": ""Immunosuppressant"", ""mechanismSynonyms"": []}, {""directMechanism"": ""Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor"", ""mechanismSynonyms"": [""3 Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor"", ""IMPDH1-""]}]}, {""drugApprovalStatus"": ""Approved"", ""drugId"": 17878, ""drugName"": ""tacrolimus (capsule)"", ""drugNameId"": 325, ""drugNames"": [""FK 506 (oral)"", ""FK-506 (oral)"", ""FK506 (oral)"", ""FR-900506 (oral)"", ""Prograf"", ""tacrolimus (capsule)""], ""drugParentNames"": [""FR-900506"", ""tacrolimus"", ""tacrolimus hydrate"", ""tacrolimus, Astellas""], ""drugPrimaryName"": ""tacrolimus (capsule)"", ""drugTherapeuticClassSynonyms"": [""Allergies, dermatological"", ""Anti-inflammatory/-pruritic, allergic"", ""Antiallergic, antipruritic/-inflammatory"", ""Antipruritic/-inflamm, allergic"", ""Antirheumatic, immunological"", ""Arthritis, immunological"", ""Cerebrovascular disease"", ""Dermatitis, allergic"", ""Eczema, allergic"", ""Immunomodulator, antiarthritic""], ""drugTherapeuticClasses"": [""Anti-inflammatory"", ""Antiarthritic, immunological"", ""Antipruritic/inflamm, allergic"", ""GI inflammatory/bowel disorders"", ""Immunosuppressant"", ""Musculoskeletal"", ""Neuroprotective"", ""Ophthalmological, other"", ""Urological""], ""mechanismsOfAction"": [{""directMechanism"": ""Calcineurin inhibitor"", ""mechanismSynonyms"": [""Calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor"", ""Calcineurin protease inhibitor"", ""Calcineurin protein phosphatase inhibitor""]}, {""directMechanism"": ""Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitor"", ""mechanismSynonyms"": [""PPIase inhibitor""]}]}, {""drugApprovalStatus"": ""Approved"", ""drugId"": 58687, ""drugName"": ""undisclosed -

(Nasdaq: SSRX), a leading biotechnology company focused on researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing biopharmaceutical products primarily in China, today announced that it has filed with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for approval of NuLeusin for the treatment of late stage metastatic renal cell carcinoma. If approved, NuLeusin is expected to be the only treatment of this kind available in China....\n\n...Clinical trials examined the safety and efficacy of two treatment cycles of subcutaneous injections of NuLeusin. During each six-week treatment cycle, patients were given daily doses of 7MIU/square meter in the induction phase and daily doses of 3.5MIU/square meter in the maintenance phase. The results showed an overall efficacy (Complete Response +Partial Response) of 12.73% and a disease control rate (Complete Response+ Partial Response+ Stable Disease) of 60%. Compared to Chiron's Proleukin, a treatment available in the United States, which is believed to be the only similar product on the market today, Nuleusin demonstrated similar levels of efficacy with a much lower dosage. More importantly, NuLeusin showed an improved safety and tolerability profile in patients who participated in the Phase III study....\n\n...About the Phase III Study\n\nThe Phase III study was a multi-center, open label, single arm study carried out in nine first-tier hospitals in Beijing. The study enrolled 75 patients with post surgery renal cell carcinoma metastasis into two six-week treatment cycles, with a two-week break between each cycle. Patients were given subcutaneous injections of 3.5MIU/ square meter NuLeusin every twelve hours, twice a day, for five consecutive days in the first week of each treatment cycle during the induction phase. From the second week onward, during the maintenance phase, patients received daily subcutaneous injections of 3.5MIU/square meter NuLeusin for five consecutive days each week. The maximum number of treatment cycles patients could receive was three. The clinical endpoint was assessed using computerized tomography scan image of tumor response.\n\nThe results of Phase III study demonstrated NuLeusin to be an effective treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma with improved safety and tolerability, with an overall efficacy of 12.73% and a disease control rate of 60% (per protocol site). The possible causes for the difference in efficacy compared to Proleukin could be variations in patient race, injection dosage, and route of administration and treatment time. The most common adverse effect related to NuLeusin was low fever and injection site reactions....\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-10-2008/0004921669&EDATE=""}, {""date"": ""2008-08-12T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""August 12, 2008\n\nExcerpted from: 3SBio Inc.

Reconstitution with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection.\n\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nTNF plays an important role in the clinical pharmacology processes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Yisaipu, the human necrosis factor-areceptor part, binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and blocks its interaction with cell surface TNF receptors. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses and plays an important role in the inflammatory processes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), and ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, TNF plays a role in the inflammatory process of plaque psoriasis. Elevated levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and plaque psoriasis.\n\nTwo distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms. Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNFR.\n\nYisaipu is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind to two TNF molecules. It inhibits the activity of TNF in vitro and has been shown to affect several animal models of inflammation, including murine collagen-induced arthritis. It inhibits binding of both TNFa and TNF\u00df to cell surface TNFRs, rendering TNF biologically inactive. Cells expressing trans-membrane TNF that bind Yisaipu are not lysed in vitro in the presence or absence of complement. Yisaipu can also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including expression of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (i.e., E-selectin and to a lesser extent intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]), serum levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-6), and serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3 or stromelysin).\n\nAPPLICATION: \nYisaipu is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Yisaipu can be initiated in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or used alone.\n\nYisaipu is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.\n\nYisaipu is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of structural damage of active arthritis in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Yisaipu can be used in combination with methotrexate in patients who do not respond adequately to methotrexate alone.\n\nYisaipu is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nYisaipu is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (18 years or older) with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. \n\n[URL has expired]\nhttp://www.cpgj-pharm.com/en/product_patient.asp?proid=22""}, {""date"": ""2008-02-20T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. > Highlights (accessed on February 20, 2008) \n\nOctober 30, 2005 \nClinical research phase 4 of \u201cRecombinant Human Necrosis Factor-aReceptor :IgG Fc (rhTNFR:Fc) Fusion Protein for Injection\u201d project officially started. \n\n[URL has expired] \nhttp://www.cpgj-pharm.com/en/about07.asp""}, {""date"": ""2008-01-07T00:00:00Z"", ""details"": ""January 7, 2008 \n\nProject \u201cYISAIPU - antibody fusion protein for RA treatment\u201d was granted second prize of State Scientific and Technological Award for 2007 \n\nAfter 8 year research and development, YISAIPU - the antibody drug indicating to self-immune diseases such like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis, obtained the second prize of State Scientific and Technological Award for 2007 .

The control group, including 102 patients, was given 10,000 IU EPIAO three times a week for eight weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was the improvement of the Hemoglobin level for > 1-2 g/dL compared to the baseline level. The trial result shows that 70% of patients on high- dose EPIAO injections had Hemoglobin improvement of at least 1-2 g/dL from baseline level, similar to those receiving three times per week dosing of 10,000 IU EPIAO. In addition, the patients were assessed with the peak Hemoglobin value, the nadir of Hemoglobin value, the time it took for the Hemoglobin level to increase for more than 1g/dL and 2g/dL, and the need for blood transfusion for each group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in these secondary endpoints.\n\nIn addition, the safety of high-dose EPIAO was comparable to the 10,000 IU EPIAO. The most common adverse effect related to high-dose EPIAO was low fever.

Efficacy and safety of postoperative recurrent-metastases first-line subgroup in the HOPES study was comparable to previous clinical studies of trastuzumab as first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\nConclusions: Inetetamab has shown efficacy and safety equivalent to trastuzumab for patients in the first-line treatment of postoperative recurrence-metastases HER2-positive breast cancer, which confirms its important status and potential as first-line treatment. Inetetamab provides more first-line targeted therapy options for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38751509/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11093085/""}]","[""efficacy"", ""multiple arm"", ""observational"", ""open label"", ""randomized"",
